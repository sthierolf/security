# CVE-2021-35061

## Vulnerability information
Multiple **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) vulnerabilities in DRK Odenwaldkreis Testerfassung March2021 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via all parameters to HTML form fields in all components.


## Vulnerability description
JavaScript or HTML Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found on various forms used in DRK Odenwaldkreis Testerfassung web portal.
The multiple vulnerabilities have been demonstrated and have been confirmed by the developers in code version March-2021. DRK Odenwaldkreis
and developers were contacted, vulnerability was reported, confirmed and fixed in latest software release.


## Mitigation
Mitigation can be accomplished by filtering user input with PHP function **strip_tags()** and using for example an allow list of allowed characters.


## Technical Description
Injection of JavaScript alert box to demonstrate Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    result.php?TOKEN=">1234567890&ID=[NUMBER]

The **$_POST** and **$_GET** variables passed from HTML forms should be passed to an **input filtering** function which checks for allowed characters,
cast the type of the variable (integer, float, string) and **strip_tags()** should be used to remove all characters used in JavaScript or HTML.

  /**
   * Input from $_POST (or $_GET) is not filtered.
   *
   * Mitigation: Input filtering, Allow list, deny of manipulated input,
   * PHP escape function strip_tags().
   */
  $token = $_POST['token'];
  $customer_key = $_POST['customer_key'];
  //$gebdatum = $_POST['gebdatum'];
  $gebdatum_d = $_POST['gebdatum_d'];
  $gebdatum_m = $_POST['gebdatum_m'];
  $gebdatum_y = $_POST['gebdatum_y'];
  $gebdatum=sprintf('%04d',$gebdatum_y).'-'.sprintf('%02d',
  $gebdatum_m).'-'.sprintf('%02d',$gebdatum_d);
